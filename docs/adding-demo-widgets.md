# Adding Demo Widgets

TODO:

At present, demo widgets are added by default. But eventually, we'll remove them from
the dynamic service init script, and have a separate tool for adding demo widgets.

This should help user's get started with a style of widget - data viewer, app output
viewer, python or javascript.
